Java throws keyword
------------------
The Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception. It gives an information to the programmer that there may occur an exception so it is better for the programmer to provide the exception handling code so that normal flow can be maintained.
Exception Handling is mainly used to handle the checked exceptions. If there occurs any unchecked exception such as NullPointerException, it is programmers fault that he is not performing check up before the code being used.

Syntax of java throws
----------------------
return_type method_name() throws exception_class_name{  
//method code  
} 

Which exception should be declared
Ans) checked exception only, because:
unchecked Exception: under your control so correct your code.
error: beyond your control e.g. you are unable to do anything if there occurs VirtualMachineError or StackOverflowError.


Example
----------
import java.io.IOException;  
class Testthrows1{  
  void m()throws IOException{  
    throw new IOException("device error");//checked exception  
  }  
  void n()throws IOException{  
    m();  
  }  
  void p(){  
   try{  
    n();  
   }catch(Exception e){System.out.println("exception handled");}  
  }  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
   Testthrows1 obj=new Testthrows1();  
   obj.p();  
   System.out.println("normal flow...");  
  }  
}  

Output:
exception handled
normal flow...
